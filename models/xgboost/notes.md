# XGBoost models

### Peter R.

- Here is the code I used to run XGBoost models with forest EVI break data.  
- The folder "paper" holds clean versions of the Python code (Jupyter Notebook) developed during my PhD. Use the code in this folder to replicate some of my analyses.
- The folder "exploratory" and "archive" hold other (and older) versions of the code.
