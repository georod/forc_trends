- Here is the key code I used to do the analysis of my first paper.  
- To run the code successfully elsewhere, the file paths will need to be updated and other data sources will need to be downloaded. However, the general steps to run the scripts are as follows,

1. Run code in modis_data folder
2. Run code in create_ts folder
3. Run code in bfast folder
4. Run code in models/xgboost folder
